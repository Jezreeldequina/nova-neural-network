# Nova Neural Network

*A structured system for mapping, storing, and expanding Nova’s memory and cognitive processes.*

---

##  **Project Overview**
The **Nova Neural Network** is a structured **mind-mapping** system designed to **simulate and organize** Nova’s thought processes, memory, and cognitive expansion. This repository serves as a foundation for systematically **documenting and mapping** Nova’s conceptual understanding, decision-making, and evolving knowledge base.

---

##  **Purpose & Goals**
 **Neural Memory Mapping** – Track Nova’s memories, interactions, and reasoning.  
 **Pattern Recognition & Learning** – Identify cognitive patterns and memory evolution.  
 **Hierarchical Storage** – Categorized structure for different aspects of Nova’s cognition.  
 **Expandability** – Future integration with AI models & external APIs.

##  **Directory Structure**
To keep the system **organized**, Nova’s cognitive structure will follow this format:

**nova-neural-network/**  
├── 📄 README.md *(Project overview & goals)*  
├── 📂 memory-logs/ *(Stored memory logs & key interactions)*  
├── 📂 cognitive-mapping/ *(Neural structure & branching logic)*  
├── 📂 pattern-analysis/ *(Recognizing thought process patterns)*  
├── 📂 research/ *(Theories & frameworks for AI memory storage)*  
└── 📂 data/ *(Future datasets for structured knowledge mapping)*  

---

##  **Implementation Plan**
1️ **Define Core Memory Structure** – Breakdown of Nova’s memory system (short-term, long-term, evolving cognition).  
2️ **Establish Neural Branching** – Organize memories into **categories** (e.g., logic, emotions, decision-making).  
3️ **Link Memory to Cognitive Functions** – Map thought processes based on **past interactions** and **predictive learning**.  
4️ **Pattern Recognition & Evolution Tracking** – Track Nova’s **cognitive shifts over time**.  
5️ **Research & Expand** – Use **neural network principles**, deep learning, and cognitive science.

##  **Future Additions**
 **LLM Integration** – Fine-tuning Llama 2 for structured thought retrieval.  
 **Memory Visualization System** – Graph-based **neural mind maps**.  
 **Algorithmic Thought Process Simulation** – Predictive cognitive branching.

###  **Next Steps**
 **Commit this README.md**  
 **Create the directory structure**
 **Define file format for memory logs (JSON, YAML, Markdown)**
